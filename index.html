        <b> Creative Writing </b> <br>
        <i> Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers </i> to get their creative flow going at
        the beginning of
        the day. The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This forces the
        writer to
        use creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first
        one of
        a short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they
        create.
        The third option is to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of
        these
        challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their
        writing.
        <br><br>
        <strong> Tackle Writers' Block </strong> <br>
        <em> A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to tackle </em> writers' block. Writing block
        can often happen
        due to being stuck with a current project that the writer is trying to complete. By inserting a completely
        random
        paragraph from which to begin, it can take down some of the issues that may have been causing the writers' block
        in the
        first place.
        <br><br>
        <b> Beginning Writing Routine </b> <br>
        <mark>Another productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing routine. </mark> One way is to generate a
        random paragraph with
        the intention to try to rewrite it while still keeping the original meaning. The purpose here is to just get the
        writing
        started so that when the writer goes onto their day's writing projects, words are already flowing from their
        fingers.
